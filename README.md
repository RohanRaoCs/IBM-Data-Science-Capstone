üöÄ IBM Applied Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Launch Prediction Project
Predicting SpaceX First Stage Landings with Data Science: A Capstone Project Applying Real-World Data, Visualization, and Machine Learning

üìå Overview
Welcome to the repository for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone, the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization on Coursera. This capstone provides a hands-on opportunity to apply all the concepts learned across the program, including data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning, to a real-world project.

üõ∞Ô∏è Project Background: SpaceX Launch Prediction
SpaceX has revolutionized the aerospace industry by developing reusable rocket technology, significantly reducing launch costs. The Falcon 9, priced at around $62 million, is considerably cheaper than competitors, largely due to the ability to recover and reuse its first stage.

This project aims to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land, helping to estimate mission costs and inform launch strategy.

üîç Research Questions
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, orbit, and number of previous flights affect the success of a first stage landing?

Has the rate of successful landings improved over the years?

Which machine learning algorithm is best suited for predicting binary landing outcomes?

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Data Collection
Used SpaceX REST API

Performed Web Scraping from Wikipedia

2. Data Wrangling
Filtered and cleaned data

Handled missing values

Applied One-Hot Encoding to prepare data for machine learning

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
